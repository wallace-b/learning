The sales are in thousands of units, while the advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper) are in thousands of dollars.
```{r Q1 Part C, D & E}

ad <- read.csv("F:/Documents/Advertising_Updated.csv")
lm <- lm(Sales~., data=ad)
summary(lm)
new.dat <- data.frame(TV=200, Radio=10, Newspaper=20)
predict(lm,newdata=new.dat,interval="prediction")

```

Week 12 Practice Question 6

```{r Q6}

library(queueing)
i_mm1 <- NewInput.MM1(lambda=125.7,mu=127.05,n=100)
# Build the model
o_mm1 <-QueueingModel(i_mm1)
Report(o_mm1)



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
