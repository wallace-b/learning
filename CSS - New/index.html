        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <p class="desc-skill-1">I have spent most of my life developing my problem solving skills. When I was younger, in school I had interests in Maths and Sciences, and playing video games and Lego.
          I wanted to succeed and these things and strived towards getting good results and having a good time. My problem solving skills became well-developed during my univeristy
          undergraduate in Civil Engineering. In fact, this was probably the Number One skill I walked away with - a well-refined problem solving mindset. My professional career as
          a Civil Engineer, and the challenges that come along with working in the profession, matured these skills greatly in an industry setting. I believe achieving Chartered
          Engineer status in Australia is testament to these skills, and having professional integrity, reaching a high level that is peer-recognised.
          Now I am currently on my next step to pivot into software development and working hard at my Master's Degree in Data Analytics.

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p class="desc-skill-2">After seeing the wonders of Machine Learning in action within fields that really interest me - such as AlphaStar, AlphaGo, AlphaZero and Driverless Vehicle technology -
          I began my pursuit to pivot into the software development and Machine Learning field. I had several courses in my undergraduate Civil Engineering degree that were focused option
          coding and a few courses that involved Neural Networks and evolutionary models for solving a multivariate solution space. I have been working hard at my studies and developing
          my coding abilities since the beginning of 2019. I believe I have a logical mind, capable of abstraction, well-suited to software development and coding.
