# 0. Course Outline

Videos on Youtube, Code on Vizhub

1. Use D3 and React for data visualization in JavaScript.
2. Fork from Vizhub for own code modifications
3. Vega-Lite API Template to make visualizations and modify visualizations quickly.
4. Rendering Data in D3 and React, set axes, and different plot styles (bar charts, maps, etc.).
5. Use React hooks to create interactivity on visualizations.
6. Create advanced interactivity, such as hovering tooltips or using a slider on a map.

# 1. What is Data Visualization?

Using some material from Visualization Analysis & Design - Tamara Munzer, University of British Columbia

## Why have a human in the loop?

Computer-based visualization systems providde visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.
Visualization is suitable when there is a need to aaugment human capabilities and understanding rather tahn replace people with computational decision-making methods (i.e. Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence approaches)

### Take aways

1. Don't need visualization when a fully automatic solution exists and is trusted.
2. Many analysis problems are ill-specified. Humans don't know exactly what questions to ask in advance. So, exploratory data analysis through visualization can help refine such questions.

- It can help us better define what analysis outcomes we would like to see. It can help shape hypotheses about the datasets.

Possibilities for use of visualization:

- Long-term use for end users (e.g. exploratory analysis of scientific data).
- Presentation of known results.
- Stepping stone to better understanding requirements before developing models.
- Help developers of automatic solution refine/debug, determine parameters.
- Help end users of automatic solutions / management-exec team verify, build trust.

Replace cognition with perception, i.e. use the paper, computer display and visualizations to enhance human cognition.

# 2. Advantages of React over vanilla JavaScript

React does a much better job of allowing you to define components, and it also offers State management.
But for something simple and basic, use native JavaScript. You don't need any frameworks or libraries. A good design principle is to do thigns in the simplest way possible, with the fewest dependencies first. If that becomes too difficult and there is economy/efficiency avaiable, then utilize D3 or React, or other frameworks.

# What about Python or Tableau or Power BI?

These methods are limited in terms of the interactions and how much you can customize your visualizations. Using D3 and React offers unlimited customization of visualizations and the ability to add interactivity.
