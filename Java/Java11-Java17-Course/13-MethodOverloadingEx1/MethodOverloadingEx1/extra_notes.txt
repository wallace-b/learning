Method overloading also allows us to pass different data types (as variables) into a Method of the same name.
For example, we can pass many different data types into System.out.println( ).
In fact there are 10 methods within println( ). 
We even have string concatenation with Strings and other numerical data types! E.g. System.out.println("Yellow " + true + " hello " + 56)
