# learning
# Self-learning and my own projects are viewable here.
# I also utilise this space to keep most current versions of work.
# Some work are examples from my Master's Degree. 
# Understandably, some of these are assessment pieces, so I have removed some critical information -or- 
# provide isolated instances, as this could be used by other students taking the course.
# In such situations, I upload work long after the semester ends to prevent plaigarism / copying of answers.
