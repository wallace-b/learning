### learning - repository
### Self-learning and my own projects are viewable here.
### I also utilise this space to keep most current versions of work.
### My goal pet project is to re-create the snake game in C++ or Java and then use PyTorch to create a reinforcement learning AI to master snake.
### Some work are examples from my Master's Degree. 
### Understandably, some of these are assessment pieces, so I have removed some critical information -or- 
### provide isolated instances, as this could be used by other students taking the course.
### In such situations, I upload work long after the semester ends to prevent plaigarism / copying of answers.
